## Description
I am challenging myself to do a problem on CSES everyday to regain my confidence in Algorithms and Data Structure, prepping for competitive programming, brushing up on my problem solving skills since they are getting rusty. 
Despite having solved a lot of these problems, it's not gonna easy for my since it has been months since I last did cp. 
### Setup
- The codes are written in C++
- It is run using Visual Studio Code 
- Mac Machine
## Journaling
### April
- 30/4: 4 Introductory, 2 Sorting and Searching, 2 DP, 1 Graph
> I realized that I have completed forgotten everything about competitive programming. I had to recheck a lot of my past solutions, but it was fun.
> Note: remember to use long long for every variable
### May
- 1/5: 6 Introductory, 1 Tree, 2 Sorting and Searching, 4 DP, 2 Graph
>Note: remember how to use memset() lol. Starting to remember why I absolutely loved graph algorithms.

- 2/5: 2 Introductory, 1 DP, 1 Math, 1 Range
>I got AP CSA the day after so I couldn't really spend much time on cp today.
- 3/5: 
>Just finished AP CSA, never gonna use Java again. I have finals tomorrow so I wont be able to do much 
- 4/5: None
> It's my birthday so I'm gonna take the day off.
- 5/5: 1 Introductory

## Description
I am challenging myself to do a problem on CSES everyday to regain my confidence in Algorithms and Data Structure, prepping for competitive programming, brushing up on my problem solving skills since they are getting rusty. 
Despite having solved a lot of these problems, it's not gonna easy for my since it has been months since I last did cp. 
### Setup
- The codes are written in C++
- It is run using Visual Studio Code 
- Mac Machine
